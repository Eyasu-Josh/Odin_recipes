        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken, 
            is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have 
            been coated with seasoned flour or batter and 
            pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. 
            The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the 
            exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in 
            the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>
            <h3>ingredients</h3>
            <ul><li>12 small chicken wings</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce</li></ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol><li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 
                and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. 
                Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange 
                in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li></ol>
